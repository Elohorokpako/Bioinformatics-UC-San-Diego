# Bioinformatics UC San Diego
These are the codes for my classes with UC San Diego on the Bioinformatics specialisation. 
In the excercises, I wrote codes to 
* Count occurences of a specified pattern in a string of dna
* Find the most frequent kmers in a string of dna
* find the reverse complement of a dna string
* find the index of a each pattern occurence in a string of dna
* find clump which are the clustering of dna in a certain given window (length of dna) which met a certain criteria
* finding SkewArray
* computing hamming_distance between two strings of texts
* computing pattern_matching between pattern and a string of text to return the index of the texts which match the pattern
* and others....
