# Bioinformatics-week-1
This is the week 1 of my classes with UC San Diego on the Bioinformatics specialisation. 
In the excercises, I wrote codes to 
* Count occurences of a specified pattern in a string of dna
* Find the most frequent kmers in a string of dna
* find the reverse complement of a dna string
* find the index of a each pattern occurence in a string of dna
* find clump which are the clustering of dna in a certain given window (length of dna) which met a certain criteria
